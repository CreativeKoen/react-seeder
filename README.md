# React Seeder

This is a react seeder project.
The master branch will contain a simple react app to get data in a table with bootstrap styling.
There will be other branch with a react app that work with a framework.

Also this is the beginning of a project for my portfolio in which I create or consume data from localstorage or public api's.

### TODO
- [ ] create a flux app
- [ ] create a redux app
- [ ] create a relay app
